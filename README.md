</p>
<p>
Using the information of the two users created in the previous osTicket lab (Ken and Karen), we will create two separate tickets.
</p>
<p>
End users can select the specific 'Help Topic' to categorize the issue or request of their ticket. Then an 'Issue Summary' is created to allow understanding of a ticket at a glance. Next describe the issue you are having within the text box below and upload any necessary files to help explain the situation such as screenshots. Once the ticket has been filled out, click on 'Create Ticket'.

Below you can see we have filled out a ticket as 'ken' who is having a 'Personal Computer Issue'.

<p>
The next ticket will be made as 'karen' and categorized as a 'Business Critical Outage'. Once the tickets have been created they will be sent to the Agents' queue to be resolved.

<h2>Assignment and Communication</h2>
<p>
Clicking on a ticket takes us to the ticket details, this is how the tickets appear from jane doe's perspective. As jane doe, you can click on the various options in the ticket and adjust them as needed. The options include the ticket's Status, Priority, Department, Assigned To, and SLA plan. If we click on each of these things, we can adjust them according to the ticket's priority or impact.

The Agent can also message the End User through the Ticket Thread to update the User or other Agents about the status of the ticket. At the bottom, you can also adjust the Ticket's Status if the issues have been resolved.
